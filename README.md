# Cash Manager App 
This Vanilla JS app would help you calculate the minimum number of notes you need to return to a customer when he/she pays the bill.

### How does the App work?
The App has currencies of Rupees 2000, 500, 100, 50, 20, 10, 5, 1. The user would have to do the following things:

1. Enter the Bill amount
2. Enter the Cash Given amount
3. Click on the Check Button.

As soon as the user does this, they would come to know the minimum number of notes they have to return to the customer. The App also takes care of edge cases wherein
the Cash Given is less than the Bill Amount or Bill Amount entered is less than zero. Try the app now!
